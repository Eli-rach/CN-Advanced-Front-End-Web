# Reflection

Well, my group definately aimed for the moon.  Don't think we reached it though.  For our project, we wanted a collaborative todo list that anyone could edit and we could see who added what.  We ended up with a responsive single collaborative todo list.  Still pretty good but we had to compromise for sure.  Part of this had to do with the fact that I could not get authentication working for to allow for seperate logins. A big challenege was catching up on languages and libraries. We decided to learn firebase and I needed to catch up on typescript, and I aslo threw SASS and react-route-doms so it was a lot still.  Truth be told, it felt like an application of what the other two had learned while I was still learning.  Overall, not a bad use of my time but I wish I was able to bring more and complete my end of the project (definately gonna finish it over winter break!)
