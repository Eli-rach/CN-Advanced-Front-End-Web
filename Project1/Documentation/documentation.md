# Online Dice Simulator

A project designed in three.js and cannon-es, I want to be able to roll different sided dice online without it just being a random number generator.  

## First Steps

To begin, I started both learning the libraries better and also modeling all 7 of the dice (D4, D6, D8, D10, D100, D12 and D20) in blender. After doing so we hopped into the website!

Afterwards, we needed to set up a physical plane and get a simulated dice rolling. The issue came when mapping the dice which I am still working on.

## Next Steps

I am nowhere done, there are multiple parts I still wish to incorperate into this project:

- [ ] Map the Dice to the given created blender model.
- [ ] Create a rollable model for each of the dice.
- [ ] roll mutiple dice at once.
- [ ] sum up the dice total.
