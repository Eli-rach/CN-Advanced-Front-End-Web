# Project 2(ish)

So, I don't have much to add here for much of a propasal in terms of wireframes.  In terms of my last project, I worked on an online dice rolling simulator.  I wish to continue this but have a lot more feasable timeline than what I gave myself last time. 

## The Goals

* Use Typescript as opposed to javascript in cadance with this porject.
* Get the D6 mapped to the physical object
* Get all other dice to work properly and roll.

## IF complete I will work on these

* Reset Button.
* Choose the dice you roll.
* Generate a floor where the dice don't fall.
* Use the Quanteraion result of the dice to generate a readable number to display.
* Work with the HTML side and generate a better HUD.
